'''GitHub''' is a [[Git (software)|Git]] repository [[Shared web hosting service|web-based hosting service]], which offers all of the [[distributed revision control]] and [[source code management]] (SCM) functionality of Git as well as adding its own features. Unlike Git, which is strictly a [[command-line]] tool, GitHub provides a [[Web application|web-based graphical interface]] and desktop as well as mobile integration.  It also provides [[access control]] and several collaboration features such as [[wiki]]s, [[task management]], and [[bug tracking system|bug tracking]] and [[software feature|feature requests]] for every project.<ref name="hugeinvestment">{{cite web|url=http://techcrunch.com/2012/07/09/github-pours-energies-into-enterprise-raises-100-million-from-power-vc-andreesen-horowitz/ |title=GitHub Pours Energies into Enterprise – Raises $100 Million From Power VC Andreessen Horowitz |date=July 9, 2012|first1=Alex |last1=Williams |publisher=Tech Crunch |quote=Andreessen Horowitz is investing an eye-popping $100 million into GitHub}}</ref>

GitHub offers both paid plans for private [[repository (revision control)|repositories]] and free accounts, which are usually used to host [[open-source]] software projects.  As of 2014, GitHub reports having over 3.4 million users,<ref name="ucc">{{cite web|last1=Whitaker|first1=Marisa|title=Former UC student establishes a celebrated website in GitHub that simplifies coding collaboration for millions of users|url=http://magazine.uc.edu/favorites/web-only/wanstrath.html|publisher=University of Cincinnati|accessdate=2014-07-09|date=April 2014}}</ref> making it the largest code host in the world.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Georgios Gousios|author2=Bogdan Vasilescu|author3=Alexander Serebrenik|author4=Andy Zaidman|title=Lean GHTorrent: GitHub Data on Demand|page=1|url=http://flosshub.org/sites/flosshub.org/files/lean-ghtorrent.pdf|accessdate=9 July 2014|publisher=Delft University of Technology & †Eindhoven University of Technology|location=The Netherlands|quote=During recent years, GITHUB (2008) has become the largest code host in the world.}}</ref>

GitHub has become such a staple among the [[Open source community|open-source development community]] that many [[Computer programmers|developers]] have begun considering it a replacement for a conventional resume, and some employers require applicants to provide a link to and have an active contributing GitHub account in order to qualify for a job.<ref name="gitresume">{{cite web|url=http://code.dblock.org/github-is-your-new-resume |title=Github Is Your New Resume |date=July 14, 2011|accessdate=2014-07-09 |last1=Doubrovkine |first1=Daniel}}</ref><ref name="githubisresume">{{cite web|url=http://anti-pattern.com/github-is-your-resume-now |title=Github Is Your Resume Now |date=June 17, 2012 |accessdate=2014-07-09}}</ref>{{Unreliable fringe source|date=September 2014}}

== Services ==

=== GitHub ===
Development of the GitHub platform began on 19 October 2007.<ref name="beginning">{{cite web|url=http://blogs.esri.com/esri/arcgis/2014/02/10/github-ceo-and-co-founder-chris-wanstrath-keynoting-esris-devsummit/ |title=GitHub CEO and Co-Founder Chris Wanstrath Keynoting Esri’s DevSummit! |first1=Kristina |last1=Weis |date=2014-02-10 | quote=in 2007 they began working on GitHub as a side project}}</ref><ref name="githuboneyear">{{cite web|url=https://github.com/blog/185-github-turns-one|title=GitHub Turns One!|work=GitHub|date=October 19, 2008|first=Tom|last=Preston-Werner|accessdate=2014-03-28}}</ref> The site was launched in April 2008 by [[Tom Preston-Werner]], Chris Wanstrath, and PJ Hyett after it had been made available for a few months prior as a beta period.<ref name="pastie"/>

Projects on GitHub can be accessed and manipulated using the standard git command-line interface and all of the standard git commands work with it.  GitHub also allows registered and non-registered users to browse public repositories on the site.  Multiple desktop clients have also been created by GitHub and other third parties which integrate with the platform.

The site provides [[social networking]] functionality such as feeds, followers, wikis (using gollum [[Wiki software]]) and a [[social network graph]] to display how developers work on their versions ("[[fork (software development)|forks]]") of a repository and which fork is newest.

A user must create a profile in order to contribute content to the site, but public repositories can be browsed and downloaded by anyone. With a registered user account, users are able to discuss, manage, create repositories, submit contributions to others' repositories, and [[code review|review changes to code]].

GitHub also operates other services: a [[pastebin]]-style site called Gist<ref name="pastie"/> which is for hosting code snippets, whereas GitHub proper would be for hosting larger projects, and a [[slide hosting service]] called Speaker Deck.

The software that runs GitHub was written using [[Ruby on Rails]] and [[Erlang (programming language)|Erlang]] by GitHub, Inc. (previously known as Logical Awesome) developers Chris Wanstrath,<ref name="wanstrathinterview">{{cite web|url=http://doeswhat.com/2012/03/06/interview-with-chris-wanstrath-github/ |title=Interview with Chris Wanstrath |publisher=Doeswhat.com |date=2012-03-06 |accessdate=2013-02-26}}</ref> PJ Hyett, and [[Tom Preston-Werner]].

GitHub launched a new program to give students free access to their tools on October 7th, 2014. It is called the GitHub Student Developer Pack. GitHub will partner with [[Bitnami]], [[Crowdflower]], [[DigitalOcean]], DNSimple, HackHands, [[Namecheap]], Orchestrate, Screenhero, [[SendGrid]], [[Stripe (company)|Stripe]], [[Travis CI]] and [[Unreal Engine]] to launch the program.<ref>By Frederic Lardinois, TechCrunch. “[http://techcrunch.com/2014/10/07/github-partners-with-digital-ocean-unreal-engine-and-others-to-give-students-free-access-to-developer-tools/ GitHub Partners With Digital Ocean, Unreal Engine, Others To Give Students Free Access To Developer Tools].” October 7, 2014.

==== Scope ====
GitHub is mostly used for code, but is also sometimes used for non-code types of files like [[Final Cut Pro X|Final Cut]] or [[Word document#File formats|Word documents]]. GitHub is not solely for programmers: in their educational videos, GitHub states that any "knowledge worker" (defined as almost any professional who makes use of a computer) can benefit.

In addition to [[source code]], GitHub supports the following formats and features:

* 3D render files which can be previewed using a new integrated STL file viewer which displays the files on a 3D canvas.<ref name="3d">{{cite web|url=http://makezine.com/2013/04/09/github-now-supports-stl-file-viewing/ | title=GitHub Now Supports STL File Viewing |date=2013-04-09|last1=Weinhoffer |first1=Eric}}</ref> The viewer is powered by [[WebGL]] and [[Three.js]].
* [[Photoshop]]'s native PSD format can be previewed and compared to previous versions of the same file.
* Nested [[to do list|task-lists]]
* Documentation and wikis
* Small [[website]]s can be hosted from public repositories on GitHub. The URL format is http://''projectname''.github.io.
* [[Issue tracking]] (including feature requests)
* Visualization of [[geospatial]] data
* [[Gantt chart]]s

==== Terms of Service ====
GitHub's Terms of Service does not require public software projects hosted on GitHub to meet the [[Open Source Definition]].

=== GitHub Enterprise ===
GitHub Enterprise is similar to GitHub's public service but is designed for use by large-scale enterprise software development teams where the enterprise wishes to host their repositories behind a corporate [[firewall (computing)|firewall]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://github.com/blog/978-introducing-github-enterprise|accessdate=13 July 2014|title=Introducing GitHub Enterprise|publisher=GitHub}}</ref>

=== Gist ===
Tom Preston-Werner presented the new Gist feature at a punk rock Ruby conference in 2008.<ref>{{cite conference |title=God's memory leak - a scientific treatment |first=Tom |last=Preston-Werner |url=https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/god-rb/Acyit8SlgcI |date=2008-07-20 |conference= RubyFringe |conferenceurl=https://unspace.ca/rubyfringe/ |accessdate=2014-10-21|quote=He previewed the upcoming git feature gist }}</ref>
Gist builds upon that idea by adding version control for code snippets, easy forking, and SSL encryption for private pastes. Because each “gist” is its own Git repository, multiple code snippets can be contained in a single paste and they can be pushed and pulled using Git. Further, forked code can be pushed back to the original author in the form of a patch, so pastes can become more like mini-projects.

==Company==

===Organizational structure===

{{asof|2012|12}}, GitHub, Inc. was a [[flat organization]] with no middle managers; in other words, "everyone is a manager" ([[Workers' self-management|self-management]]).<ref name='cto-mgmt-style'>{{cite web|url=http://tomayko.com/writings/management-style|title=Show How, Don't Tell What - A Management Style|author=Ryan Tomayko|date=2 April 2012|accessdate=28 August 2013}}</ref> Employees can choose to work on projects that interest them ([[open allocation]]).
