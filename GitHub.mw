=== Mascot ===
GitHub's [[mascot]], Mona, is a female [[anthropomorphized]] "octocat" with five [[Cephalopod limb|octopus-like arms]].<ref name="Octodex FAQ" /><ref name="Jaramillo" /> The character was created by graphic designer [[Simon Oxley]] as [[clip art]] to sell on [[iStock]],<ref name="DeAmicis">{{Cite website|url=https://pando.com/2013/07/08/original-github-octocat-designer-simon-oxley-on-his-famous-creation-i-dont-remember-drawing-it/|title=Original GitHub Octocat designer Simon Oxley on his famous creation: "I don’t remember drawing it"|last=DeAmicis|first=Carmel|date=8 July 2013|website=[[PandoDaily]]|access-date=2017-04-19}}</ref> a website that enables designers to market [[royalty-free]] [[digital image]]s.

GitHub became interested in Oxley's work after Twitter selected a bird that he designed for their own logo.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fastcodesign.com/1672164/meet-the-accidental-designer-of-the-github-and-twitter-logos|title=Meet the Accidental Designer of the GitHub and Twitter Logos|last=Campbell-Dollaghan|first=Kelsey|date=26 April 2013|website=Co.Design|publisher=Fast Company|access-date=2017-04-19}}</ref> The illustration GitHub chose was a character that Oxley had named Octopuss.<ref name="DeAmicis" /> Since GitHub wanted Octopuss for their logo (a use that the iStock license disallows), they negotiated with Oxley to buy exclusive rights to the image.<ref name="DeAmicis" />

GitHub renamed Octopuss to Octocat,<ref name="DeAmicis" /> and trademarked the character along with the new name.<ref name="Octodex FAQ" /> Later, GitHub hired illustrator Cameron McEfee to adapt Octocat for different purposes on the website and promotional materials; McEfee and various GitHub users have since created hundreds of variations of the character.<ref name="McEfee">{{cite web|url=http://cameronmcefee.com/work/the-octocat/|title=The Octocat—a nerdy household name|last=McEfee|first=Cameron|date=12 May 2016|website=CameronMcEfee.com|publisher=Cameron McEfee|access-date=2017-04-19}}</ref>

=== Organizational structure ===
GitHub, Inc. was originally a [[flat organization]] with no middle managers; in other words, "everyone is a manager" ([[Workers' self-management|self-management]]).<ref name="cto-mgmt-style">{{cite web|url=https://tomayko.com/writings/management-style|title=Show How, Don't Tell What - A Management Style|last=Tomayko|first=Ryan|date=2 April 2012|accessdate=28 August 2013}}</ref> Employees can choose to work on projects that interest them ([[open allocation]]).

Projects on GitHub can be accessed and manipulated using the standard Git command-line interface and all of the standard Git commands work with it. GitHub also allows registered and non-registered users to browse public repositories on the site. Multiple desktop clients and Git [[Plug-in (computing)|plugin]]s have also been created by GitHub and other third parties that integrate with the platform.

The site provides [[social networking]]-like functions such as feeds, followers, wikis (using [[wiki software]] called [[Gollum Wiki|Gollum]]) and a [[Collaboration graph|social network graph]] to display how developers work on their versions ("[[fork (software development)|forks]]") of a repository and what fork (and branch within that fork) is newest.

A user must create an account in order to contribute content to the site, but public repositories can be browsed and downloaded by anyone. With a registered user account, users are able to discuss, manage repositories, submit contributions to others' repositories, and [[code review|review changes to code]].

The software that runs GitHub was written using [[Ruby on Rails]] and [[Erlang (programming language)|Erlang]] by GitHub, Inc. developers Chris Wanstrath,<ref name="wanstrathinterview">{{cite web |url = http://doeswhat.com/2012/03/06/interview-with-chris-wanstrath-github/ |title = Interview with Chris Wanstrath |publisher = Doeswhat.com |date = 2012-03-06 |accessdate = 2013-02-26 }}</ref> PJ Hyett, and [[Tom Preston-Werner]].

==== Licensing of repositories ====
GitHub's Terms of Service do not require public software projects hosted on GitHub to meet the [[Open Source Definition]]. For that reason, it is essential for users and developers intending to use a piece of software found on GitHub to read the [[software license]] in the repository (usually found in a top-level file called "LICENSE", "LICENSE.txt", or similar) to determine if it meets their needs{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}.
The [[Terms of Service]] state, "By setting your repositories to be viewed publicly, you agree to allow others to view and fork your repositories."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://help.github.com/articles/github-terms-of-service/ |title=GitHub Terms of Service - User Documentation |publisher=Help.github.com |date=2016-02-11 |accessdate=2016-12-05}}</ref>

=== GitHub Enterprise ===
GitHub Enterprise is similar to GitHub's public service but is designed for use by large-scale enterprise software development teams where the enterprise wishes to host their repositories behind a corporate [[firewall (computing)|firewall]].<ref>{{cite web |url = https://github.com/blog/978-introducing-github-enterprise |accessdate = 13 July 2014 |title = Introducing GitHub Enterprise |publisher = GitHub }}</ref>

=== Gists ===
GitHub also operates other services: a [[pastebin]]-style site called '''Gist'''<ref name="pastie"/> that is for hosting [[Snippet (programming)|code snippets]] (GitHub proper is for hosting larger projects), and a [[slide hosting service]] called Speaker Deck.

Tom Preston-Werner presented the then-new Gist feature at a punk rock Ruby conference in 2008.<ref>{{cite conference |title = God's memory leak - a scientific treatment |first = Tom |last = Preston-Werner |url = https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/god-rb/Acyit8SlgcI |date = 2008-07-20 |conference = RubyFringe |conferenceurl = https://unspace.ca/rubyfringe/ |accessdate = 2014-10-21 |quote = He previewed the upcoming git feature gist }}</ref> Gist builds on the traditional simple concept of a [[pastebin]] by adding version control for code snippets, easy forking, and SSL encryption for private pastes. Because each "gist" has its own Git repository, multiple code snippets can be contained in a single paste and they can be pushed and pulled using Git. Further, forked code can be pushed back to the original author in the form of a patch, so gists (pastes) can become more like mini-projects.

=== Education program ===
GitHub launched a new program called the GitHub Student Developer Pack to give students free access to popular development tools and services. GitHub partnered with [[Bitnami]], [[Crowdflower]], [[DigitalOcean]], [[DNSimple]], [[HackHands]], [[Namecheap]], Orchestrate, Screenhero, [[SendGrid]], [[Stripe (company)|Stripe]], [[Travis CI]] and [[Unreal Engine]] to launch the program.<ref>{{cite web|first=Frederic|last=Lardinois|publisher=TechCrunch|url=https://techcrunch.com/2014/10/07/github-partners-with-digital-ocean-unreal-engine-and-others-to-give-students-free-access-to-developer-tools/|title=GitHub Partners With Digital Ocean, Unreal Engine, Others To Give Students Free Access To Developer Tools|date=7 October 2014|access-date=7 October 2014}}</ref>

=== GitHub Marketplace service ===
GitHub also provides some [[software as a service]] integrations for adding extra features to projects. Those services include:
* Waffle.io: Project management for software teams. Automatically see pull requests, automated builds, reviews, and deployments across all of your repositories in GitHub.
* Rollbar: Integrate with GitHub to provide real time debugging tools and full-stack exception reporting. It is compatible with all well used code languages, such as JavaScript, Python, .Net, Ruby, PHP, Node.js, Android, iOS, Go, Java and C#.
* Codebeat: For automated code analysis specialized in web and mobile developers. The supported languages for this software are: Elixir, Go, Java, Swift, JavaScript, Python, Ruby, Kotlin, Objective-C, TypeScript.
* [[Travis CI]]: To provide confidence for your apps while doing test and ship. Also gives full control over the build environment, to adapt it to the code. Supported languages: Go, Java, JavaScript, Objective-C, Python, PHP, Ruby and Swift.
* GitLocalize: Developed for teams that are translating their content from one point to another. GitLocalize automatically syncs with your repository so you can keep your workflow on GitHub. It also keeps you updated on what needs to be translated.
