=== GitHub ===
Development of the GitHub platform began on October 1, 2007.<ref name="beginning">{{cite web|url=http://blogs.esri.com/esri/arcgis/2014/02/10/github-ceo-and-co-founder-chris-wanstrath-keynoting-esris-devsummit/ |title=GitHub CEO and Co-Founder Chris Wanstrath Keynoting Esriâ€™s DevSummit! |first1=Kristina |last1=Weis |date=2014-02-10 | quote=in 2007 they began working on GitHub as a side project}}</ref><ref name="githuboneyear">{{cite web|url=https://github.com/blog/185-github-turns-one|title=GitHub Turns One!|work=GitHub|date=19 October 2008|first=Tom|last=Preston-Werner|accessdate=2014-03-28}}</ref> The site was launched in April 2008 by [[Tom Preston-Werner]], Chris Wanstrath, and PJ Hyett after it had been made available for a few months prior as a beta period.<ref name="pastie">{{cite web|url = http://www.sitepoint.com/github-gist-is-pastie-on-steroids/ |title=GitHub Gist is Pastie on Steroids | date=24 July 2008|first1=Josh|last1=Catone}}</ref>

Projects on GitHub can be accessed and manipulated using the standard git command-line interface and all of the standard git commands work with it.  GitHub also allows registered and non-registered users to browse public repositories on the site.  Multiple desktop clients and git plugins have also been created by GitHub and other third parties which integrate with the platform.

The site provides [[social networking]]-like functions such as feeds, followers, wikis (using [[wiki software]] called gollum) and a [[Collaboration graph|social network graph]] to display how developers work on their versions ("[[fork (software development)|forks]]") of a repository and which fork (and branch within that fork) is newest.

A user must create an account in order to contribute content to the site, but public repositories can be browsed and downloaded by anyone. With a registered user account, users are able to discuss, manage, create repositories, submit contributions to others' repositories, and [[code review|review changes to code]].

The software that runs GitHub was written using [[Ruby on Rails]] and [[Erlang (programming language)|Erlang]] by GitHub, Inc. developers Chris Wanstrath,<ref name="wanstrathinterview">{{cite web|url=http://doeswhat.com/2012/03/06/interview-with-chris-wanstrath-github/ |title=Interview with Chris Wanstrath |publisher=Doeswhat.com |date=2012-03-06 |accessdate=2013-02-26}}</ref> PJ Hyett, and [[Tom Preston-Werner]].

==== Scope ====
GitHub is mostly used for code.

In addition to [[source code]], GitHub supports the following formats and features:

* Documentation, including automatically-rendered [[README]] files in a variety of [[Markdown]]-like file formats (see [[README#On GitHub|README files on GitHub]])
* [[Issue tracking]] (including feature requests)
* [[Wikis]]
* Small [[website]]s can be hosted from public repositories on GitHub. The URL format is http://''username''.github.io.
* Nested [[to do list|task-lists]] within files
* Visualization of [[Geospatial analysis|geospatial]] data
* [[Gantt chart]]s
* 3D render files which can be previewed using a new integrated STL file viewer which displays the files on a 3D canvas.<ref name="3d">{{cite web|url=http://makezine.com/2013/04/09/github-now-supports-stl-file-viewing/ | title=GitHub Now Supports STL File Viewing |date=2013-04-09|last1=Weinhoffer |first1=Eric}}</ref> The viewer is powered by [[WebGL]] and [[Three.js]].
* [[Photoshop]]'s native PSD format can be previewed and compared to previous versions of the same file.

==== Licensing of repositories ====
GitHub's Terms of Service do not require public software projects hosted on GitHub to meet the [[Open Source Definition]]. Therefore (and in any case) it is advisable for users and developers intending to use a piece of software found on GitHub to read the [[software license]] in the repository (usually found in a top-level file called "LICENSE", "LICENSE.txt", or similar) to determine if it meets their needs.

=== GitHub Enterprise ===
GitHub Enterprise is similar to GitHub's public service but is designed for use by large-scale enterprise software development teams where the enterprise wishes to host their repositories behind a corporate [[firewall (computing)|firewall]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://github.com/blog/978-introducing-github-enterprise|accessdate=13 July 2014|title=Introducing GitHub Enterprise|publisher=GitHub}}</ref>

=== Gist ===
GitHub also operates other services: a [[pastebin]]-style site called Gist<ref name="pastie"/> which is for hosting code snippets (GitHub proper is for hosting larger projects), and a [[slide hosting service]] called Speaker Deck.

Tom Preston-Werner presented the then-new Gist feature at a punk rock Ruby conference in 2008.<ref>{{cite conference |title=God's memory leak - a scientific treatment |first=Tom |last=Preston-Werner |url=https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/god-rb/Acyit8SlgcI |date=2008-07-20 |conference= RubyFringe |conferenceurl=https://unspace.ca/rubyfringe/ |accessdate=2014-10-21|quote=He previewed the upcoming git feature gist }}</ref> Gist builds on the traditional simple concept of a [[pastebin]] by adding version control for code snippets, easy forking, and SSL encryption for private pastes. Because each "gist" has its own Git repository, multiple code snippets can be contained in a single paste and they can be pushed and pulled using Git. Further, forked code can be pushed back to the original author in the form of a patch, so gists (pastes) can become more like mini-projects.

=== Education Program ===
GitHub launched a new program on October 7, 2014 called the GitHub Student Developer Pack to give students free access to popular development tools and services. GitHub partnered with [[Bitnami]], [[Crowdflower]], [[DigitalOcean]], [[DNSimple]], HackHands, [[Namecheap]], Orchestrate, Screenhero, [[SendGrid]], [[Stripe (company)|Stripe]], [[Travis CI]] and [[Unreal Engine]] to launch the program.<ref>By Frederic Lardinois, TechCrunch.

==Company==
GitHub, Inc. was originally known as Logical Awesome.

In 2014, GitHub's former CEO [[Tom Preston-Werner]] resigned from the company.<ref name="NYTResigns">{{cite web|url=http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/04/21/github-founder-resigns-after-investigation/?_php=true&_type=blogs&hp&_r=0|title=GitHub Founder Resigns After Investigation|first=Claire Cain|last=Miller|publisher=The New York Times|work=Bits|date=21 April 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://techcrunch.com/2014/04/21/github-denies-allegations-of-gender-based-harassment-co-founder-preston-werner-resigns/|title=GitHub Denies Allegations Of "Gender-Based Harassment," Co-Founder Preston-Werner Resigns|work=TechCrunch|last=Wilhelm|first=Alex|date=21 April 2014}}</ref><ref name="Follow up to the investigation results">{{cite web|url=https://github.com/blog/1826-follow-up-to-the-investigation-results|title=Follow up to the investigation results|date=28 April 2014}}</ref>

GitHub's salespeople are not paid on a commission basis.<ref name="forbes">{{cite web|url=http://www.forbes.com/sites/tomiogeron/2012/07/09/cash-for-code-github-raises-100-million-from-andreessen-horowitz/ |title=Github Raises $100 Million From Andreessen Horowitz |date=9 July 2012 |publisher=Forbes}}</ref>

===Organizational structure===

{{asof|2012|12}}, GitHub, Inc. was a [[flat organization]] with no middle managers; in other words, "everyone is a manager" ([[Workers' self-management|self-management]]).<ref name='cto-mgmt-style'>{{cite web|url=http://tomayko.com/writings/management-style|title=Show How, Don't Tell What - A Management Style|author=Ryan Tomayko|date=2 April 2012|accessdate=28 August 2013}}</ref> Employees can choose to work on projects that interest them ([[open allocation]]). However, salaries are set by the chief executive.<ref name='nyt'>{{cite news|url=http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/12/28/github-has-big-dreams-for-open-source-software-and-more/?_r=0|title=Dreams of 'Open' Everything|author=Quentin Hardy|publisher=New York Times}}</ref>{{update inline|date=August 2014}}

In 2014, GitHub, Inc. introduced a layer of middle management.<ref name="wsj-2014">{{cite news|url=http://online.wsj.com/articles/harassment-claims-make-startup-github-grow-up-1405639553|title=Harassment claims make startup GitHub grow up|last=Evelyn|first=Rusli|work=[[Wall Street Journal]]|accessdate=18 July 2014|date=17 July 2014}}</ref>

===Finance===
GitHub.com is a [[Startup company|start-up business]], which in its first years provided enough revenue to be funded solely by its three founders and start taking on employees.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Michael|first1=Carney|title=GitHub CEO explains why the company took so damn long to raise venture capital|url=http://pando.com/2013/06/20/github-ceo-explains-why-the-company-took-so-damn-long-to-raise-venture-capital/|accessdate=10 July 2014|date=20 June 2013|publisher=PandoDaily}}</ref>  In July 2012, four years after the company was founded, [[Andreessen Horowitz]] invested $100M in [[venture capital]].<ref name="hugeinvestment"/>
