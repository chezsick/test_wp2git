'''GitHub''' is a [[Shared web hosting service|web-based hosting service]] for projects that use the [[Git (software)|Git]] revision control system. It is written using [[Ruby on Rails]] by Logical Awesome developers Chris Wanstrath, PJ Hyett, and Tom Preston-Werner. GitHub offers both commercial plans and free accounts for open source projects. According to the Git User's Survey in 2008, GitHub is the most popular Git hosting site.<ref>[http://www.survs.com/WO/WebObjects/Survs.woa/wa/shareResults?survey=M3PIVU72&rndm=OKJQ45LAG8 Git User's Survey 2008]</ref>

The site provides social networking functionality like feeds, followers and the network graph to display how developers work on their versions of a repository.

GitHub also operates a [[pastebin]]-style site at [http://gist.github.com gist.github.com], wikis for the individual repositories and web pages that can be edited through a git repository.
