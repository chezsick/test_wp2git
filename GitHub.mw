=== Gist ===
GitHub also operates other services: a [[pastebin]]-style site called Gist<ref name="pastie"/> which is for hosting code snippets (GitHub proper is for hosting larger projects), and a [[slide hosting service]] called Speaker Deck.

Tom Preston-Werner presented the then-new Gist feature at a punk rock Ruby conference in 2008.<ref>{{cite conference |title=God's memory leak - a scientific treatment |first=Tom |last=Preston-Werner |url=https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/god-rb/Acyit8SlgcI |date=2008-07-20 |conference= RubyFringe |conferenceurl=https://unspace.ca/rubyfringe/ |accessdate=2014-10-21|quote=He previewed the upcoming git feature gist }}</ref> Gist builds on the traditional simple concept of a [[pastebin]] by adding version control for code snippets, easy forking, and SSL encryption for private pastes. Because each "gist" has its own Git repository, multiple code snippets can be contained in a single paste and they can be pushed and pulled using Git. Further, forked code can be pushed back to the original author in the form of a patch, so gists (pastes) can become more like mini-projects.
