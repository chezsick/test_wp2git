==Description==
The site provides social networking functionality such as feeds, followers and the network graph to display how developers work on their versions of a repository.

GitHub also operates other services: a [[pastebin]]-style site called Gist<ref>[https://gist.github.com/gists Github:gist]</ref> that provides wikis for individual repositories and web pages that can be edited through a Git repository, a [[slide hosting service]] called Speaker Deck,<ref>[https://speakerdeck.com/ Speaker Deck website]</ref> and a [[web analytics]] platform called Gauges.<ref>[http://get.gaug.es/]</ref>

{{As of|2010|1}}, GitHub is operated under the name GitHub, Inc.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://github.com/blog/589-new-year-new-company | title = New Year, New Company | work = GitHub blog | date = 21 January 2010 | first = PJ | last = Hyett}}</ref>
