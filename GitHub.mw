==Description==
The site provides social networking functionality such as feeds, followers and the network graph to display how developers work on their versions of a repository.

GitHub also operates a [[pastebin]]-style site called Gist,<ref>[https://gist.github.com/gists Github:gist]</ref> wikis for individual repositories, and web pages that can be edited through a Git repository.

{{As of|2010|1}}, GitHub is operated under the name GitHub, Inc.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://github.com/blog/589-new-year-new-company | title = New Year, New Company | work = GitHub blog | date = 21 January 2010 | first = PJ | last = Hyett}}</ref>

The software that runs GitHub was written using [[Ruby on Rails]] and [[Erlang_(programming_language)|Erlang]] by GitHub, Inc. (previously known as Logical Awesome) developers Chris Wanstrath,<ref>[http://doeswhat.com/2012/03/06/interview-with-chris-wanstrath-github/ Interview with Chris Wanstrath]</ref> PJ Hyett, and Tom Preston-Werner.
