=== GitHub ===
Development of the GitHub platform began on October 1, 2007.<ref name="beginning">{{cite web|url=http://blogs.esri.com/esri/arcgis/2014/02/10/github-ceo-and-co-founder-chris-wanstrath-keynoting-esris-devsummit/ |title=GitHub CEO and Co-Founder Chris Wanstrath Keynoting Esriâ€™s DevSummit! |first1=Kristina |last1=Weis |date=2014-02-10 | quote=in 2007 they began working on GitHub as a side project}}</ref><ref name="githuboneyear">{{cite web|url=https://github.com/blog/185-github-turns-one|title=GitHub Turns One!|work=GitHub|date=19 October 2008|first=Tom|last=Preston-Werner|accessdate=2014-03-28}}</ref> The site was launched in April 2008 by [[Tom Preston-Werner]], Chris Wanstrath, and PJ Hyett after it had been made available for a few months prior as a beta period.<ref name="pastie">{{cite web|url = http://www.sitepoint.com/github-gist-is-pastie-on-steroids/ |title=GitHub Gist is Pastie on Steroids | date=24 July 2008|first1=Josh|last1=Catone}}</ref>

Projects on GitHub can be accessed and manipulated using the standard git command-line interface and all of the standard git commands work with it.  GitHub also allows registered and non-registered users to browse public repositories on the site.  Multiple desktop clients and git plugins have also been created by GitHub and other third parties which integrate with the platform.

The site provides [[social networking]]-like functions such as feeds, followers, wikis (using [[wiki software]] called gollum) and a [[Collaboration graph|social network graph]] to display how developers work on their versions ("[[fork (software development)|forks]]") of a repository and which fork (and branch within that fork) is newest.

A user must create an account in order to contribute content to the site, but public repositories can be browsed and downloaded by anyone. With a registered user account, users are able to discuss, manage, create repositories, submit contributions to others' repositories, and [[code review|review changes to code]].

The software that runs GitHub was written using [[Ruby on Rails]] and [[Erlang (programming language)|Erlang]] by GitHub, Inc. developers Chris Wanstrath,<ref name="wanstrathinterview">{{cite web|url=http://doeswhat.com/2012/03/06/interview-with-chris-wanstrath-github/ |title=Interview with Chris Wanstrath |publisher=Doeswhat.com |date=2012-03-06 |accessdate=2013-02-26}}</ref> PJ Hyett, and [[Tom Preston-Werner]].

==== Scope ====
GitHub is mostly used for code.

In addition to [[source code]], GitHub supports the following formats and features:

* Documentation, including automatically-rendered [[README]] files in a variety of [[Markdown]]-like file formats (see [[README#On GitHub|README files on GitHub]])
* [[Issue tracking]] (including feature requests)
* [[Wikis]]
* Small [[website]]s can be hosted from public repositories on GitHub. The URL format is http://''username''.github.io.
* Nested [[to do list|task-lists]] within files
* Visualization of [[Geospatial analysis|geospatial]] data
* [[Gantt chart]]s
* 3D render files which can be previewed using a new integrated STL file viewer which displays the files on a 3D canvas.<ref name="3d">{{cite web|url=http://makezine.com/2013/04/09/github-now-supports-stl-file-viewing/ | title=GitHub Now Supports STL File Viewing |date=2013-04-09|last1=Weinhoffer |first1=Eric}}</ref> The viewer is powered by [[WebGL]] and [[Three.js]].
* [[Photoshop]]'s native PSD format can be previewed and compared to previous versions of the same file.

==== Licensing of repositories ====
GitHub's Terms of Service do not require public software projects hosted on GitHub to meet the [[Open Source Definition]]. Therefore (and in any case) it is advisable for users and developers intending to use a piece of software found on GitHub to read the [[software license]] in the repository (usually found in a top-level file called "LICENSE", "LICENSE.txt", or similar) to determine if it meets their needs.

=== GitHub Enterprise ===
GitHub Enterprise is similar to GitHub's public service but is designed for use by large-scale enterprise software development teams where the enterprise wishes to host their repositories behind a corporate [[firewall (computing)|firewall]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://github.com/blog/978-introducing-github-enterprise|accessdate=13 July 2014|title=Introducing GitHub Enterprise|publisher=GitHub}}</ref>

=== Gist ===
GitHub also operates other services: a [[pastebin]]-style site called Gist<ref name="pastie"/> which is for hosting code snippets (GitHub proper is for hosting larger projects), and a [[slide hosting service]] called Speaker Deck.

Tom Preston-Werner presented the then-new Gist feature at a punk rock Ruby conference in 2008.<ref>{{cite conference |title=God's memory leak - a scientific treatment |first=Tom |last=Preston-Werner |url=https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/god-rb/Acyit8SlgcI |date=2008-07-20 |conference= RubyFringe |conferenceurl=https://unspace.ca/rubyfringe/ |accessdate=2014-10-21|quote=He previewed the upcoming git feature gist }}</ref> Gist builds on the traditional simple concept of a [[pastebin]] by adding version control for code snippets, easy forking, and SSL encryption for private pastes. Because each "gist" has its own Git repository, multiple code snippets can be contained in a single paste and they can be pushed and pulled using Git. Further, forked code can be pushed back to the original author in the form of a patch, so gists (pastes) can become more like mini-projects.

=== Education Program ===
GitHub launched a new program on October 7, 2014 called the GitHub Student Developer Pack to give students free access to popular development tools and services. GitHub partnered with [[Bitnami]], [[Crowdflower]], [[DigitalOcean]], [[DNSimple]], HackHands, [[Namecheap]], Orchestrate, Screenhero, [[SendGrid]], [[Stripe (company)|Stripe]], [[Travis CI]] and [[Unreal Engine]] to launch the program.<ref>By Frederic Lardinois, TechCrunch.
