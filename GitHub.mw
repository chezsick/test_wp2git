'''GitHub''' is a [[Shared web hosting service|web-based hosting service]] for software development projects that use the [[Git (software)|Git]] [[revision control]] system. GitHub offers both paid plans for private repositories, and free accounts for [[open source]] projects. The site was launched in 2008 by [[Tom Preston-Werner]], Chris Wanstrath, and PJ Hyett.

==Description==
The site provides [[social networking]] functionality such as feeds, followers, wikis (using gollum [[Wiki software]]) and the [[social network graph]] to display how developers work on their versions of a repository.

{{As of|2010|1}}, GitHub is operated under the name GitHub, Inc.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://github.com/blog/589-new-year-new-company | title = New Year, New Company | work = GitHub blog | date = 21 January 2010 | first = PJ | last = Hyett}}</ref>
