'''GitHub''' is a [[Shared web hosting service|web-based hosting service]] for software development projects that use the [[Git (software)|Git]] [[revision control]] system. GitHub offers both paid plans for private repositories, and free accounts for [[open source]] projects. The site was launched in 2008 by [[Tom Preston-Werner]], Chris Wanstrath, and PJ Hyett.

==Description==
GitHub is home to over 13.1 million repositories, making it the largest code host in the world.

The site provides [[social networking]] functionality such as feeds, followers, wikis (using gollum [[Wiki software]]) and the [[social network graph]] to display how developers work on their versions of a repository.

A user must create a profile before using the site. It allows individuals to participate in live conversations and chats to discuss, manage, or review changes to code.
GitHub is mostly used for code, but also commonly used for non-code types of files like Final Cut or Word documents.

One can share this code with co-workers, friends, classmates or strangers. Users revise projects, edit other people’s work, and interact with other members.
It can be used among co-workers to edit or contribute to the same documents or websites since a version control application allows multiple people to work simultaneously without work getting overwritten or erased.

GitHub also operates other services: a [[pastebin]]-style site called Gist<ref>{{cite web|url=https://gist.github.com/gists |title=Github:gist |publisher=Gist.github.com |date= |accessdate=2013-02-26}}</ref> that provides wikis for individual repositories and web pages that can be edited through a Git repository, a [[slide hosting service]] called Speaker Deck.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://speakerdeck.com/ |title=Speaker Deck website |publisher=Speakerdeck.com |date= |accessdate=2013-02-26}}</ref>

The software that runs GitHub was written using [[Ruby on Rails]] and [[Erlang (programming language)|Erlang]]<ref>{{cite web |url= https://github.com/blog/112-supercharged-git-daemon | title = Supercharged git-daemon | work = GitHub blog | date = 13 July 2008 | first = Mojombo}}</ref> by GitHub, Inc.

==Statistics==
GitHub was launched in April 2008.<ref name="launched" /> Development of the GitHub platform began on October 19, 2007.<ref name='githuboneyear'>{{cite web|url=https://github.com/blog/185-github-turns-one|title=GitHub Turns One!|work=GitHub|date=October 19, 2008|first=Tom|last=Preston-Werner|accessdate=2014-03-28}}</ref>

The meaning of “Git”- An open-source version control system→ started by Linus Torvalds. 

The “Hub”- The center around which all things involving Git revolve→ ergo “GitHub.”

Version Control Systems (VCS)- records changes to a file or set of files over time so that one can recall specific versions later.

==Criticism==

===Allegations of harassment and departure of an employee ===
In March 2014 a former female developer, Julie Ann Horvath, suggested a discriminatory environment at GitHub. In an interview to [[TechCrunch]] she complained about the start-up's culture, leaving the firm after repeated harassment from a (at first not publicly identified) founder's non-employee wife and witnessing male co-workers "gawking" at some female co-workers who were hula-hooping.<ref>[http://valleywag.gawker.com/github-engineer-quits-after-alleging-gender-harassment-1544559154 GitHub Engineer Quits After Alleging Gender Harassment].

It did, however, find "evidence of mistakes and errors of judgment." In light of this, Preston-Werner resigned from GitHub in April 2014. <ref>[https://github.com/blog/1823-results-of-the-github-investigation Results of the GitHub Investigation · GitHub].
